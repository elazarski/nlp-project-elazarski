# Final Project

Use what you have learned in this class to develop an application that uses natural language processing. Your project can use any of the concepts that youâ€™ve learned in this course, including n-grams, part-of-speech tagging, text classification, grammars, vector semantics, neural language models, and information extraction. The requirements are intentionally vague to allow you to create an application that interests you. If you are stuck for an idea, look at the starred exercises in the NLTK Book for inspiration.

### Requirements for this assignment:
Develop an application that use natural language processing. The application must:
- use an NLP concept discussed in this course
- be developed using python
- perform an interesting task
- be substantial, including at least 50 lines of code
- have well formatted and organized code
